# visualActivism
a website displaying secondary research on visual activism about its history and an analysis of its impacts

# Description
This website is a display of a secondary research project on visual activism. Especially with the events of summer 2020 and the pandemic, the explosion of aesthetic infographics informing users about various social inequalities and conveying complex data in digestible charts has changed how information and news has been shared online, especially on social media platforms. I answered: What is the evolution of data visualization and visual activism into the age of social media? As the political climate changes, more people turn to social media to advocate for social change. Some corporations have seen the change in climate and have used their social media for good. My other two team members explored the concept of performative activism within the scope of visual graphics, whether the actions of corporate social media accounts are genuine or moved by the prospect of profit, and how performative activism affects society and social movements.
